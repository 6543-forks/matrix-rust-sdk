// JUST AN IDEA
//

/// This is just a thought I had. Making users impl a trait instead of writing callbacks for events
/// could give the chance for really good documentation for each event?
/// It would look something like this
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use matrix-sdk::{AsyncClient, EventEmitter};
///
/// struct MyAppClient;
///
/// impl EventEmitter for MyAppClient {
///     fn on_room_member(&mut self, room: &Room, event: &RoomEvent) { ... }
/// }
/// async fn main() {
///     let cl = AsyncClient::with_emitter(MyAppClient);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And in `AsyncClient::sync` there could be a switch case that calls the corresponding method on
/// the `Box<dyn EventEmitter>
pub trait EventEmitter {
    fn on_room_name(&mut self, _: &Room, _: &RoomEvent) {}
    /// Any event that alters the state of the room's members
    fn on_room_member(&mut self, _: &Room, _: &RoomEvent) {}
}
